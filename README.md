# 🎵 Cadenza Lyric Intelligibility Challenge

The **Cadenza Lyric Intelligibility Challenge (CLIP1)** is a research-driven initiative that explores how well humans and machine systems can understand sung lyrics under varying acoustic and musical conditions.  
It aims to bridge the gap between **music production, speech science, and AI** by evaluating intelligibility across diverse singing styles, languages, and recording contexts.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The challenge focuses on **predicting and analyzing lyric intelligibility** — how clearly words are perceived when sung.  
Participants develop computational models or analytical pipelines to:
- Assess the intelligibility of vocal recordings  
- Identify factors that degrade or enhance lyric clarity  
- Explore correlations between **acoustic, linguistic, and perceptual** features  

The ultimate goal is to **advance tools that support artists, engineers, and researchers** in improving vocal clarity and accessibility in music.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- **Studio and live vocal recordings** with controlled background conditions  
- **Perceptual scores** collected from listening tests evaluating intelligibility  
- **Acoustic and linguistic features**, such as spectral clarity, phoneme accuracy, and signal-to-noise ratios  

These data allow participants to investigate how production choices, vocal styles, and background mix levels influence lyric perception.

## 🔬 Research Themes
- Speech intelligibility modeling in musical contexts  
- Audio feature extraction and signal processing for sung vocals  
- Cross-domain analysis between speech and music perception  
- Development of intelligibility-aware music production tools
