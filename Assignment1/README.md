# CADENZA LYRIC INTELLIGIBILITY CLIP1

Project: Cadenza Lyric Intelligibility – Assignment 1  
Course: CS-272 (Artificial Intelligence)  
Task: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---------------------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW
---------------------------
This project focuses on analyzing lyric intelligibility using the dataset provided in the Cadenza challenge.  
The notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on audio and metadata files to understand data 
distributions, extract key features (e.g., MFCCs, spectral measures), and visualize trends related to intelligibility.
